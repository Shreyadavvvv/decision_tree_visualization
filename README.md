# decision_tree_visualization

📂 Decision Tree Classifier with Scikit-learn
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree classification model built using Scikit-learn on the classic Iris dataset.
It includes:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🌳 Model training using DecisionTreeClassifier
🧠 Model visualization using plot_tree()
📈 Evaluation using accuracy and classification report
💬 Key insights on interpretability and feature importance
🔍 Objective:
To understand the inner workings of a Decision Tree model by not only training it, but also visualizing the decision paths for better interpretability.

📎 Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
